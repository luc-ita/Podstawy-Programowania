"""
A stack is a linear data structure that follows
the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
This means the last element added to the stack
is the first one to be removed. Think of a stack
as a pile of plates â€” the last plate you place
on the top is the first one you'll take off.

print('Number of stack elements:', cards.qsize())

# removes and prints elements from the top of the stack

Note the order of the printed elements.
The last added element is printed first.
